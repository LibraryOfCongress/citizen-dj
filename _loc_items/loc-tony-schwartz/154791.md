They tell how much time they spend on the subway, how they feel about the subway, and what can be done to improve the subway. 2.

This audio recording is part of the [Tony Schwartz Collection](https://www.loc.gov/rr/record/schwartzcollection.html) at the Library of Congress. Considered a master of the electronic media, Tony Schwartz changed the face of radio and television advertising by creating socially conscientious campaigns such as the nationâ€™s first anti-smoking ad, which led the tobacco industry to stop advertising on television and radio. Those and other materials are part of the vast archives of sound recordings and moving images created and collected by the renowned New York City sound documentarian, producer, author and teacher.
