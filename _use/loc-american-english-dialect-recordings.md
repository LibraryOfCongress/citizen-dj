title: "American English Dialect Recordings"
description: "The Center for Applied Linguistics Collection contains 118 hours of recordings documenting North American English dialects. The recordings include speech samples, linguistic interviews, oral histories, conversations, and excerpts from public speeches. They were drawn from various archives, and from the private collections of fifty collectors, including linguists, dialectologists, and folklorists."
rights: "The sound recordings from this collection that are part of the Citizen DJ project are free to use and reuse. You can copy, modify, distribute and perform the works, even for commercial purposes, all without asking permission. The American Folklife Center at the Library of Congress asks that artists approach the materials in this collection with respect for the culture and sensibilities of the people whose lives, ideas, and creativity are documented here. Artists are also reminded that privacy and publicity rights may pertain to certain uses of this material. Attribution is recommended but not required."
rights_explanation: "The Center for Applied Linguistics donated the recordings to the Library of Congress in 1986. Although these recordings came with no releases, permissions research was undertaken by Library staff as part of their work to make this collection available online. Citizen DJ includes only those interviews where there was written permission given to the Library by the interviewee."
