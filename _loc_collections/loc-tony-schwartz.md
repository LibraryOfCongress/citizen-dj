title: "Tony Schwartz Collection"
description: "Considered a master of the electronic media, Tony Schwartz changed the face of radio and television advertising by creating socially conscientious campaigns such as the nationâ€™s first anti-smoking ad, which led the tobacco industry to stop advertising on television and radio. Those and other materials are part of the vast archives of sound recordings and moving images created and collected by the renowned New York City sound documentarian, producer, author and teacher."
rights: "The sound recordings from this collection that are part of the Citizen DJ project are free to use and reuse. You can copy, modify, distribute and perform the works, even for commercial purposes, all without asking permission. Attribution is recommended but not required."
rights_explanation: "In 2007, Tony Schwartz's entire body of work was acquired by the Library of Congress, thus the Library reserves the right to make his recordings available for reuse as long as those recordings do not contain embedded material to which Schwartz did not own the copyright. Therefore, Citizen DJ excludes: (1) recordings that contain music or speeches from identifiable or named performers and composers, (2) radio broadcasts, and (3) commercials."
