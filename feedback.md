## Send me feedback

There are three main ways to give me feedback:

1. If you found a technical bug or would like to make a feature request, you can [submit an issue on Github](https://github.com/LibraryOfCongress/citizen-dj/issues) if you have a Github account. This is preferred since we will be able to start a thread and you will get updates on how I address your issue or request.

2. Submit any question, comment, issue, or request via [this Google form](https://forms.gle/H1jABaT8M67yUduA7). If you are asking a question, be sure to leave your email address so I can respond.

3. Email me at {{ site.email }}.
