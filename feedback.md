## Send me feedback

There are a few ways to give me feedback:

1. Submit any suggestion, comment, issue, or request via [this online form](https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/BRNX3W5).

2. If you found a technical bug or would like to make a feature request, you can [submit an issue on Github](https://github.com/LibraryOfCongress/citizen-dj/issues) if you have a Github account. This is preferred since we will be able to start a thread and you will get updates on how I address your issue or request.

3. If you have a question that needs a response, you can email me at {{ site.email }}. Due to high volume of emails, I may not be able to respond to all questions or inquiries, but I will read them and incorporate them into my design and development process.
