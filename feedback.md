## Send me feedback

There are a few ways to give me feedback:

1. You can participate in a user testing session which you can [join using this link](/?l11_uid=65990). The session should take no longer than 15 minutes.

2. If you found a technical bug or would like to make a feature request, you can [submit an issue on Github](https://github.com/LibraryOfCongress/citizen-dj/issues) if you have a Github account. This is preferred since we will be able to start a thread and you will get updates on how I address your issue or request.

3. Submit any suggestion, comment, issue, or request via [this online form](https://www.research.net/r/XZRZY9D).

4. If you have a question that needs a response, you can email me at {{ site.email }}.
