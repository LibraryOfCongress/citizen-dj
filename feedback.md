## Send me feedback

**May 15, 2020 marks the end of the first round of feedback for Citizen DJ which we will be analyzing and applying to the next round of changes. You may continue to submit feedback, but we may not be able to address it until after we address the first round of feedback. Starting June 2020, you can find what we're currently working on in the [Github project page](https://github.com/LibraryOfCongress/citizen-dj/projects/1).**

There are a few ways to give me feedback:

1. Submit any suggestion, comment, issue, or request via [this online form](https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/BRNX3W5).

2. If you found a technical bug or would like to make a feature request, you can [submit an issue on Github](https://github.com/LibraryOfCongress/citizen-dj/issues) if you have a Github account. This is preferred since we will be able to start a thread and you will get updates on how I address your issue or request.

3. If you have a question that needs a response, you can email me at {{ site.email }}. Due to high volume of emails, I may not be able to respond to all questions or inquiries, but I will read them and incorporate them into my design and development process.
