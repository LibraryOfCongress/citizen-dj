## Send me feedback

There are three main ways to give me feedback:

1. If you found a technical bug or would like to make a feature request, you can [submit an issue on Github](https://github.com/LibraryOfCongress/citizen-dj/issues) if you have a Github account. This is preferred since we will be able to start a thread and you will get updates on how I address your issue or request.

2. Submit any suggestion, comment, issue, or request via [this online form](https://www.research.net/r/XZRZY9D).

3. If you have a question that needs a response, you can email me at {{ site.email }}.
