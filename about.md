## About Citizen DJ

The Citizen DJ project invites the public to make hip hop music using the public audio and video collections from the [Library of Congress](https://loc.gov/). By embedding these materials in hip hop music, listeners can discover items in the Library's vast collections that they likely would never have known existed.

### Why Hip Hop?

Since its beginnings in the 1970s, hip hop has become today's dominant worldwide music genre and cultural movement. At the center of this movement is the DJ, whose role is to excavate, transform, and collage disparate and obscure sounds from current and past cultures to create wholly new, relevant, and infectious music.

The [golden age of hip hop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_age_hip_hop) was said to be in the late 80s to early 90s when DJs had unconstrained creative freedom to collage from found sounds. This small window of time produced landmark albums such as [Public Enemy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_Enemy_(band))'s [Fear of a Black Planet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fear_of_a_Black_Planet) and [De La Soul](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_La_Soul)'s [3 Feet High & Rising](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3_Feet_High_and_Rising), both considered to be culturally significant and selected for preservation in the [National Recording Registry](https://www.loc.gov/programs/national-recording-preservation-board/recording-registry/complete-national-recording-registry-listing/) at the [Library of Congress](https://www.loc.gov/). These albums were dense and intricate sonic collages composed of hundreds of found sounds. However, the increasing popularity of hip hop in the following decade gave rise to [high profile lawsuits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Upright_Music,_Ltd._v._Warner_Bros._Records_Inc.) resulting in excessive restrictions on how audio could be sampled. Today, collage-based hip hop as it existed in the golden age is largely a lost (or at best, a prohibitively expensive) artform.

I believe if there was **a simple way to discover, access, and use public domain audio and video material for music making**, a new generation of hip hop artists and producers can maximize their creativity, invent new sounds, and **connect listeners to materials, cultures, and sonic history** that might otherwise be hidden from public ears.

### Why the Library of Congress?

### What kind of sounds are you looking for?

### How are you finding and selecting your sounds?

### How will you be making these sounds available, searchable, and discoverable?

### How will you deal with copyright law around digital sampling?

### How will you deal with the ethics of digital sampling?

### Who are you?

### What is the timeline of this project?

### Prior work and inspirations

### How can I follow along?
