summary: "RXF 3661: Traffic in New York (Tony Schwartz, interviewer ; Mike Rowan, interviewee) (0:00). \"An interview with Mike Rowan, who travels a lot. He thinks that the sidewalks should be made wider, and the streets narrower, in order to discourage people from bringing their cars into the city. We need a better public transportation system linked to the suburbs. Buckminster Fuller, says Rowan, points out that vertical transportation has been developing faster than horizontal transportation. Elevators and planes are a pleasure and safe when compared to an automobile\"--Accompanying collection documentation."

This audio recording is part of the [Tony Schwartz Collection](https://www.loc.gov/rr/record/schwartzcollection.html) at the Library of Congress. Considered a master of the electronic media, Tony Schwartz changed the face of radio and television advertising by creating socially conscientious campaigns such as the nationâ€™s first anti-smoking ad, which led the tobacco industry to stop advertising on television and radio. Those and other materials are part of the vast archives of sound recordings and moving images created and collected by the renowned New York City sound documentarian, producer, author and teacher.
